Create your own importer plugin
===============================

The previous section showed us how to quickly generate a template for our plugin.
The next step is to build your plugin, using the previous skeleton as an starting point.
However, this can be a daunting task if you are creating your first plugin.
To provide a easy-to-follow introduction to the plugin architecture, in the
:ref:`create_your_own_plugin` section we present a step-by-step guide creating,
from scratch, a minimal working example of an importers plugin.
This tutorial explains in detail all the elements needed for the plugin to work correctly.

plugin template.
